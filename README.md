# PasswordGenerator
A Random password generator written in C++

## How to use
You can clone this repository to your own pc, or you can just grab the code and compile it on your own device.

I have only tested it with the g++ compiler, so i can't guarantee that it works with the standard GNU C Compiler or gcc for short, so i recommend that your download the g++ compiler and use that.

**Compiling using g++:**

`$ g++ main.cpp -o PasswordGenerator`

You can substitute "PasswordGenerator" with whatever you want, it is just the name for the executable file.
